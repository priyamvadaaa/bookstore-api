## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: search books by title, new endpoint, return matching books or not found message
3. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
4. Generate Functional Requirements
5. Identify Key Entities
6. Run Review Checklist
7. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user or system client wants to search for books by title using the API and receive a list of matching books or a not found message.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the API is running with a set of books, **When** the client requests GET /books/title/<title> with a title that matches one or more books, **Then** a list of matching books is returned in JSON.
2. **Given** the API is running, **When** the client requests GET /books/title/<title> with a title that matches no books, **Then** a 404 status and a message "No books found with title containing '<title>'" is returned.

### Edge Cases
- What if the title contains special characters or mixed case? → Search is case-insensitive and matches substrings.
- What if the title is empty? → Returns all books (same as GET /books).
- What if multiple books match? → Returns all matching books in a list.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide GET /books/title/<title> endpoint.
- **FR-002**: System MUST return a list of books whose title contains the <title> substring (case-insensitive).
- **FR-003**: System MUST return 404 and a message if no books match.
- **FR-004**: System MUST respond in JSON format.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle special characters and mixed case in title search.

### Key Entities
- **Book**: id (integer, unique), title (string), author (string), price (float), stock (integer, non-negative)
