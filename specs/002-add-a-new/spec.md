# Feature Specification: Search Books by Author

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-a-new`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a new feature in the API that lets the user search books by author"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: actor (user), action (search books), data (author)
3. No major ambiguities; assume author is a string, search is case-insensitive, partial matches allowed
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (Book)
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to find books in the bookstore by searching for an author's name.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the bookstore has books by multiple authors, **When** the user searches for a specific author, **Then** the system returns all books matching that author.
2. **Given** the bookstore has no books by the searched author, **When** the user searches, **Then** the system returns a 'book not found' message.
3. **Given** the user provides a partial author name, **When** the user searches, **Then** the system returns all books with authors matching the partial name (case-insensitive).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the author field is empty or missing?
- How does the system handle special characters or whitespace in author names?
- What if multiple books have the same author?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to search for books by author name via an API endpoint.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support partial and case-insensitive matches for author names.
- **FR-003**: System MUST return a list of matching books in JSON format.
- **FR-004**: System MUST return a 'book not found' message if no books match the search.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle empty or missing author search terms gracefully.

### Key Entities
- **Book**: Represents a book in the store. Key attributes: id, title, author, price, stock.
