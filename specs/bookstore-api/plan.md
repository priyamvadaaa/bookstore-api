# Implementation Plan: Bookstore API

**Branch**: `001-bookstore-api` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: [spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/bookstore-api/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type: backend API
   → Set Structure Decision: single Python module, modular functions/classes
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
A simple RESTful API for managing a bookstore, supporting CRUD operations for books. Data is stored in-memory (list of dicts). Each book has id (int), title (string), author (string), price (float), stock (int). Endpoints: GET /books, POST /books, GET /books/<id>, PUT /books/<id>, DELETE /books/<id>. All requests and responses use JSON. Request data is validated, and errors are returned with appropriate status codes. Code is modular and clean for easy testing and maintenance.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask-RESTful  
**Storage**: In-memory (list of dicts)  
**Testing**: pytest  
**Target Platform**: Linux server  
**Project Type**: backend API  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms p95 latency, scalable to 1000 req/s  
**Constraints**: Validate request data, return JSON, proper status codes, modular code, no persistence  
**Scale/Scope**: CRUD for books, no persistence

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Code Quality: MUST follow PEP8, linting, modularity, clear structure.
- Testing Standards: TDD required, contract/integration tests for all endpoints.
- User Experience Consistency: JSON responses, standardized error handling, clear status codes.
- Performance Requirements: <200ms p95 latency, scalable to 1000 req/s.
- Maintainability & Observability: Logging, versioning, modular code.
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous.
