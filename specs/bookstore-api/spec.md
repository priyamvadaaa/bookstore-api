# Feature Specification: Bookstore API

**Feature Branch**: `[001-bookstore-api]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a simple bookstore API to manage books. It should allow listing all books, adding a book, getting details of a specific book, updating a book, and deleting a book. Data can be mocked, no need for a real database. Each book should have a title, author, price, and stock."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: API client (user, system)
   → Actions: list books, add book, get book details, update book, delete book
   → Data: Book (title, author, price, stock)
   → Constraints: No real database, data is mocked/in-memory
3. No major ambiguities; best guesses used for performance, error handling, retention
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user or system client interacts with the bookstore API to view available books, add new books, retrieve details of a specific book, update book information, and remove books from the catalog.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the API is running with a set of books, **When** the client requests GET /books, **Then** all books are returned in a list with correct fields.
2. **Given** the API is running, **When** the client sends POST /books with valid book data, **Then** the new book is added and returned with a unique id.
3. **Given** a book exists, **When** the client requests GET /books/{id}, **Then** the correct book details are returned.
4. **Given** a book exists, **When** the client sends PUT /books/{id} with updated data, **Then** the book is updated and the new details are returned.
5. **Given** a book exists, **When** the client sends DELETE /books/{id}, **Then** the book is removed and subsequent GET /books/{id} returns a not found error.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a client requests a book id that does not exist? → API returns 404 error with message "Book not found".
- How does system handle missing required fields on add/update? → API returns 400 error with message "Missing required book fields".
- What if the client tries to delete a book that does not exist? → API returns 404 error.
- What if the client sends invalid data types (e.g., price as string)? → API returns 400 error with message "Invalid data type".
- What if the stock is negative? → API returns 400 error with message "Stock must be non-negative".

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow clients to list all books via GET /books.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow clients to add a new book via POST /books with title, author, price, and stock.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow clients to retrieve details of a specific book via GET /books/{id}.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow clients to update a book via PUT /books/{id} with any subset of fields.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow clients to delete a book via DELETE /books/{id}.
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all required fields and return 400 error for missing or invalid data.
- **FR-007**: System MUST return 404 error for requests to non-existent book ids.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure stock is a non-negative integer.
- **FR-009**: System MUST respond in JSON format for all endpoints.
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD respond to all requests within 200ms (best guess reasonable performance target).
- **FR-011**: System MUST not persist data beyond process lifetime (mock/in-memory only).

### Key Entities
- **Book**: Represents a book in the catalog. Attributes: id (integer, unique), title (string), author (string), price (float), stock (integer, non-negative).

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain; best guesses used where needed and rationale noted
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (response format, error codes, timing)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (CRUD for books, in-memory only)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (mock data, no DB)

---

## Execution Status
*Updated by main() during processing*

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked (none; best guesses used)
