# Spec API Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code MUST comply with PEP8 and project linting rules. Structure must be clear and maintainable. Dead code, unused imports, and ambiguous naming are prohibited. Rationale: Ensures long-term maintainability and onboarding ease.

### II. Testing Standards
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory. All endpoints MUST have contract and integration tests written before implementation. Tests must fail before code is written (Red-Green-Refactor cycle). Rationale: Guarantees reliability and prevents regressions.

### III. User Experience Consistency
API responses MUST be consistent in format (JSON), documented, and error handling standardized. All endpoints must provide clear error messages and status codes. Rationale: Enables predictable client integration and reduces support burden.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All endpoints MUST meet minimum performance targets: <200ms p95 latency, scalable to 1000 req/s. Performance tests required for major features. Rationale: Ensures responsiveness and scalability for production use.

### V. Maintainability & Observability
Structured logging and monitoring are required for all deployed services. Versioning follows MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Breaking changes require migration plan. Rationale: Enables debugging, auditability, and safe evolution.

## Additional Constraints
Flask-Restful, Python 3.11+, pytest for testing, structured logging, deployment on Linux. All dependencies must be documented. Security best practices must be followed for API endpoints.

## Development Workflow
Code review is mandatory for all changes. All tests must pass before merge. Deployment requires approval and compliance verification with all principles. Violations must be documented and justified before proceeding.

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Versioning: MAJOR for principle removals/redefinitions, MINOR for new principles/sections, PATCH for clarifications.
