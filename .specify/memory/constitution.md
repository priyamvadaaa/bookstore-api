# Bookstore API Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code MUST be modular, readable, and maintainable. Functions and classes SHOULD be concise and well-documented. Code reviews are required for all merges. Linting and formatting tools MUST be used.

### II. Testing Standards
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory. Automated tests MUST cover all endpoints and core logic. Tests MUST be run and pass before merging. Minimum 90% code coverage is required.

### III. User Experience Consistency
API responses MUST be predictable, use consistent JSON formatting, and provide clear error messages. All endpoints MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes and helpful error details.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Endpoints MUST be efficient and respond within 500ms under normal load. Data access and serialization SHOULD be optimized. Avoid unnecessary computation in request handlers.

### V. Specification Workflow
Every new feature or change MUST be documented in a new spec file. The workflow is: create a new spec file, follow /specify, /plan, /tasks, /implement steps. Existing specs MUST NOT be modified; changes require a new spec and branch.

## Additional Constraints

- Technology stack: Python 3.10+, Flask-RESTful, pytest for testing.
- Persistent storage: Use local JSON file for data.
- Security: Validate all input, sanitize user data, avoid code injection.
- Compliance: Follow open-source best practices and licensing.

## Development Workflow

- All changes MUST be made in feature branches.
- Each feature/change gets a new spec file.
- PRs MUST include updated/new specs and passing tests.
- Code review and approval required before merge.
- Documentation auto-updated via GitHub Actions and Spec Kit.

## Governance

- This constitution supersedes all other practices.
- Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
- All PRs/reviews MUST verify compliance with principles.
- Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, incremented per governance rules.
- Use README.md and spec files for runtime development guidance.
